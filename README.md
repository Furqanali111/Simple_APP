# SIMPLE_APP

We have created simple GUI based app using object oriented programming of Python and used the external framework Kivy.<br />
We used kivy to create the GUI. the design of the GUI is kept at basic level as the project is an beginner level project..<br />

# HOW_TO_RUN_THE_APP

Step 01:<br />
  Install kivy frame work.<br />

Step 03:<br />
  Copy the inactive and active txt file to the folder where you have created the project to run this code.<br />
Step 04: (most important)<br />

# WORKING

We used double linked list as our data structure in the project.<br />
We created some basic function of the data structure(create_node, forward and backward traversing,delete node at any point, etc)<br />

We created the start tab of our project which consisted of 2 buttons(receiver button and donor button).<br />
When the user click on the donor button the user is directed to the donor tab which ask the user to fill a form as he wants to become a donor.<br />
When the user fills the form he is given 2 option exit or submit.<br />
If user click on exit button the imformation that he has written will not be saved and he will come back to the starting tab.<br />
If user click on submit button the information that user had filled will be saved(in node and file through double linked list and file handling) and used later.<br />
The user will  return to the start tab.<br />
If the user click on receiver button the information that is stored in linked list nodes(information of the donors.<br />
The user is as to enter any of the donor serial number and then asked if they haved recived the blood or not if the user says yess the information of that specific person(node).<br />
Will be deleted from the active linked list and active file and the deleted information will be saved in inactive linked list and inactive file.<br />
